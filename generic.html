									<p>In this dashboard, the recent yield vs. average yield section is analyzing the manufacturing success rate for the sub-assemblies that go into the final product. The recent yield was produced by averaging the yield/success rate of the past 3 lots, while the average yield measures the overall yield of the sub-assembly since the beginning of time. As I implemented this KPI, I was also responsible for documenting the process of calculating this yield under the SOP's of Manufacturing, and the SOP's of the Materials Planner to ensure continuity and consistency. As a participant of the Material Review Board, it was my responsibility to analyze DMR's for underperforming builds and cross-reference relative components to supplier quality data to initiate Out of Spec status' and develop an action plan based on the root cause.</p>
									<p>The Cycle Time Per Assembly section of the dashboard calculates how long it takes to produce each sub-assembly from the moment the raw material is kitted from stock, to the moment the sub-assembly is issued to stock. In order to gather appropiate data for this KPI, I created an SOP that required all technicians to timestamp the completion of each process in the Traveler - That way, once the sub-assembly and the traveler is returned to me I can easily make calculations from the time stamps per sub-assembly and calculate perpetual cycle times across the past three lots. This method was achieved electronically through Adobe Sign, and was a crucial datapoint for Project Management initiatives.</p>
									<p>The All Supplier's On Time Delivery measured the on time delivery for ALL suppliers, directly to the right you can see the average OTD%. The problem with this datapoint, and the Key Supplier datapoint is quite obvious, there is no way that any company can operate sufficiently if less than half of their raw materials are arriving late! Fortunately, that wasn't exactly the case. Finding the root cause to this situation required me to analyze Purchase Order data, and the reason why OTD is so low is because the expected delivery date for all Purchase Order's were same day. Essentially, that means that 39.4% of shipments across all supplier's were able to meet that same day delivery expectation, while 44.4% of Key Supplier shipment's were able to meet the same-day expectation. I revised the verbiage on the Purchase Requisition to emphasize that 'needed by' does not equal 'expected by', and required that quotes should be attached to all Purchase Requisitions as an effort to solve the variance. </p>
									<p>At the time of data visualization, Supplier Quality sat at 70%. I developed an action plan to increase Supplier Quality by 20%. Starting with SOP implementation in the shipping/receiving department, I drafted an SOP that required cross examining received quality documents from vendors with the requirements of quality and regulatory (A task Quality Control was responsible for, but now made pro active by shipping/receiving personnel) and if there were any variances, we contact the supplier immediately to revise the documentation prior to digitally receiving the PO. This implementation reduced Document related non conformances by 100% which meant we received material sooner, and increased Supplier Quality simultaneously. </p>
									<p>Synopsis: In governing and optimizing multiple bodies of operations, every intiative intertwined with my primary role as a Materials Planner - which was to streamline the flow of Materials, and develop plans to strategically procure material on a time and cost-effective basis for delayed completion dates and out of budget departments. With continuous improvement and optimization resting at the heart of my initiative based approach, I'm able to look at an operation from a birds eye view to make correlations between operational gaps and the gaps that I have been tasked to fill within my role.</p>
